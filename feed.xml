&lt;p&gt;This is an easy way to whitelist whole company segments of your leads, so they don’t have to wait up for manual approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. if you’re sharing your data room with a client called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Investment Bank&lt;/code&gt;, you’d add an entry for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*@investmentbank.com&lt;/code&gt; to your whitelist filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now any new leads that would sign up with their &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name@investmentbank.com&lt;/code&gt; email would be automatically approved and could see your data room right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this helps you in reducing friction when sharing secured content with your leads.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Markus</name></author><category term="New" /><summary type="html">Today we’ve added a new feature : Email whitelists.
